EVO Project Readme
--------------------

There is no installation.
Run "evo.exe"
Important note: You may want
to create your own shortcut
to this program, and customize
various things like font and
window size. I reccomend this
if the default options are
changed.

(Also, do not worry if any
 of the files created by evo
 become corrupted/messed up.
 simply delete those files,
 and evo will create clean
 ones from the defaults. You
 can then feel free to modify
 them to suit you. There are
 some internal bounds, but
 evo will warn you specifically
 which values violate them, if
 any do.)
